Steganography is the technique of hiding data within an ordinary, nonsecret file or message to avoid detection; the hidden data is then extracted at its destination. Steganography use can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data. The word steganography is derived from the Greek word steganos, meaning "hidden or covered," and the Greek root graph, meaning "to write."

Steganography software is used to perform a variety of functions, including the following:

Hiding data, including encoding the data to prepare it to be hidden inside another file.

Keeping track of which bits of the cover text file contain hidden data.

Encrypting the data to be hidden.

Extracting hidden data by its intended recipient.
